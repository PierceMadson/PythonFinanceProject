# PythonFinanceProject

To summarize my final project, I downloaded AMC's 5 year stock price data and used it to recreate the real-time graph of AMC's stock. 

Here are the steps I used to complete this:
1. Loaded the data into the notebook
2. I converted the 'Date' column to datetime in order to plot the data using mpl finance
3. Plotted the data and made visual adjustments
4. Filtered the data to capture the short squeeze (2020-2022)
5. Created an interactive plot using go.Figure
6. Added candlestick and volume traces
7. Updated the final layout and plotted the interactive plot (Not shown on Github, but it is in the file)
